This repo contains my implementations of algorithms and data structures. <br>
It is divided into 2 catalogs: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. complete - complete versions of libraries with all functions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. simple - simpler versions of libraries from the "complete" catalog, primarily meant to be used for competitive programming (stripped of everything that isn't actually useful during contests).
