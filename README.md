This repo contains implementations of algorithms and data structures. <br>
It is divided into 2 catalogs: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. complete - complete versions of libraries with all functions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. competitive - simpler versions of libraries from the "complete" catalog, predominantly useful for competitive programming (they are stripped of everything that isn't really useful during contests).
